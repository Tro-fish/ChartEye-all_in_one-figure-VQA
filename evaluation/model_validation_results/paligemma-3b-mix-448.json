Optical limit from the BOOTES telescope for FRB 20028 is also shown. Limits from the PGIR campaign are shown in orange, with transparent circles showing raw limits, while solid squares show extinction corrected limits for AJ = 2.0 mag. The four X-ray bursts detected by HXMT and NuSTAR during the PGIR observing sessions (labels indicated as per Table 2) are shown with yellow dashed lines connecting the corresponding NIR limits. For each X-ray burst, we place the fluence at the frequency corresponding to the peak of the fluence spectrum (= \u03bdf\u03bd) observed in the X-rays (and its uncertainty). The estimated fluence peak for bursts A and B are consistent with the observed spectrum of the bursts from NuSTAR observations (Borghese et al. 2020), where the fluence is observed to rise up to at least \u223c 20 keV. In the case of burst C and D, the fluence spectrum was not well constrained and hence are placed nominally at 10 keV with error-bars spanning the full HXMT sensitivity range. The observed fluence index for FRB 20028, and constraints derived for the X-ray bursts are shown."

Finally Agent5 sends the overall result to the environment. A signal from the environment activates this multi-agent system and when each agent completes the operation on its input tokens it will set its done signal and send the value of that result to the agent in the next level.

The theory has an SO(8) global symmetry represented by the square as well as a U(1) whose charges we denoted using the fugacity t. The black X on the symmetric chiral stands for an additional chiral field which couples linearly to the symmetric bilinear. In fact, due to the charges of the fields, the flip field also couples linearly to the lower antisymmetric bilinear, and so efficiently flips some combination of the two symmetric bilinears. There is also an anomaly free R symmetry under which the symmetric and lower antisymmetric have R charge 0, the quarks R charge 1 and the middle antisymmetric and flip fields have R charge ."

With an extremely small number of 0 epochs, the AdCo performs much better than the MoCo v2 by more than 5% in top- accuracy. As the epoch increases, the AdCo usually achieves the performance comparable to that of the MoCo v2 with about 30 \u223c 50 fewer epochs.

The location of the knee is determined both by the critical halo mass in the star formation efficiency, and the normalisation N, as this causes a horizontal shift of the whole distribution. For the No SN model, the slope of the faint end of the GSMF is much steeper.

We consider the effect of cosmological perturbations on the merger rate of PBH binaries in three different cases, labeled as case A, B and C, consistent with the observational constraints.

It is evident that the transmission is dependent on the outcome of the DCF; there is no deterministic transmission timeline. For this simplified example of DCF, Wi-Fi Node C has data ready for Node B. Since there is no ongoing traffic in the channel, Node C transmits data immediately after the channel is assessed to be clear for a period of DIFS. Upon a successful reception of the data frame from Node C, Node B acknowledges with an ACK frame after the short inter-frame space (SIFS) time period. Since SIFS is defined to be less than DIFS, it preempts other nodes, allowing an immediate delivery of ACK to the transmitter. During this period, Nodes A and B, as well as Node C have new data ready for transmission. However, they all have to wait until the ongoing traffic finishes. Once the channel has been cleared for the DIFS time period, each node has to start a back off timer, uniformly distributed within a contention window of length 3, 14 for Node A, 10 for Node B, and 16 for Node C for example. The timer for Node B expires first and Node B transmits. Node A receives and acknowledges. The timers for Nodes A and C freeze until ACK finishes, and resume after the channel is cleared for the DIFS period of time."

For increased measurement gain (but constant input squeezing) the relative parametric output should therefore converge to a constant level, directly indicating the absolute quadrature intensity. To observe this, we varied the pump intensity in the 2nd (measurement) pass up to 5.5 times the intensity used for generating the broadband squeezing in the 1st (generation) pass. This convergence of the relative output (dots) (GM GS >3) approached a constant level of \u223c 5% below the vacuum level. When the measurement gain is reduced, the relative output decreases due to a quantum interference effect, reaching maximum visibility when the squeezing generation gain is equal to the measurement gain (GM GS = 1). In this regime, the general measurement becomes indirect (although the squeezing effect is still directly evident), and a pair of measurements (amplifying one quadrature and then the other) is needed for extracting the quadrature information. Below the level of identical gain, the observed output strongly rises over the vacuum level, obscuring the direct evidence of squeezing; however, the quadrature information can still be extracted (though with reduced accuracy) using the same pair of measurements. The solid (blue) curve indicates a numerical simulation of the relative output, assuming the measured pump pulse energy and FWM loss, and an estimated nonlinear coefficient, fiber coupling efficiency and hyperbolic-secant pulse shape. For comparison, we included the simulated result for the relative output at the peak of the pulse (dashed green)."

At convergence, i.e. the element abundance ratios remain unchanged, the routine exit the inner loop and the base parameters are re-derived for the computed set of abundance ratios using all indices. This outer loop is iterated until the \u03c7 at step 7 stops improving by less than 1%.

This is because DR methods typically work well when the unseen target is within the scope of the class of random perturbations that are made on the source which is not the case always. In TIGDA on the other hand, every target image is made to resemble the source image through implicit sampling. Since VAE learns to sample from the entire source domain, the domain shift is implicitly reduced during inference without explicitly assuming any form for the shift.

In all cases the potential depth is the same (ER). Classically, the same potential depth would mean the same physics. However, in a quantum optical lattice, the evolution for the same depth, but different photon numbers is strikingly different. For the classical potential (constant line) the system stays in the MI state without any change. Decreasing the photon number in a cavity (the mean photon numbers are 24.2, 4., 0.97 and 0.19), the role of light fluctuations increases, which drives the atomic fluctuations destroying the MI state. The smaller the mean photon number, the stronger the systems evolution deviates from the case of a classical optical potential [12]."

In fact, the system performance is mainly array mismatches-constrained at high SNR, and undoubtedly \u2018Optimal-COBP\u2019 outperforms \u2018No-COBP\u2019 since the former mitigates the impact of array mismatches with COBP. However, the system performance is noise-constrained at low SNR and thus \u2018No-COBP\u2019 with fewer parameters to be estimated than \u2018Optimal-COBP\u2019 will be superior. 4) The CRB obtained for different numbers of subarrays almost coincide, and the reason could be explained as follows. On the one hand, more estimation parameters would increase CRB. On the other hand, mismatches across more subarrays could enhance antenna diversities and thereby improve CRB. These two factors appear to offset each other approximately. In fact, the numerical MSEs of \u2018Optimal-COBP\u2019 under different number of subarrays also asymptotically converge at high SNR. This also proves the effectiveness of COBP in mitigating the detrimental effects of inter-subarray gain and phase mismatches."

(135) and the single-repeater bound [39, 40] of Eq. (136). The key rates are expressed in terms of bits per channel use and plotted versus distance (km) at the standard fiber-loss rate of 0.2 dB per km. In particular, below the PLOB bound we consider: (CV) One-way coherent-state protocol with heterodyne detection [376], which coincides with the most asymmetric protocol for CV-MDI-QKD [182]. For long distances, the rate scales as 1/2 of the PLOB bound. The same asymptotic scaling is found for the coherent-state protocol with homodyne detection [455]; (1ph-BB84) The ideal BB84 protocol, implemented with single-photon sources [77]. This achieves the ideal rate of \u03b7/2; (decoy-BB84) BB84 protocol implemented with weak coherent pulses and decoy states achieving the ideal rate of \u03b7/(2e); (DV-MDI) Ideal implementation of a passive MDI-QKD node [176, 177]. In particular, we plot the ideal performance of decoy state DV-MDI-QKD [177] with a rate of \u03b7/(2e2). Then, we consider relay-assisted protocols able to beat the PLOB bound. In particular: (TF) Twin-field QKD protocol [183]; (PM) phase-matching QKD protocol [185]; (SNS) sending or not sending version of TF-QKD [187]; (AOPP) Active odd-parity pair protocol [190], which is an improved formulation of the SNS protocol; (NPPTF) No-phase-postselected TF-QKD protocol [191], including the variant of Ref.

Note for \u03c0 where \u00b5(\u03c0) = \u00b5(\u03c0), they coincide with the optimal policy \u00b5\u2217(\u03c0). Maximizing the volume of beliefs where \u00b5(\u03c0) = \u00b5(\u03c0) is achieved by solving a linear programming problem as described in \u00a78.4."

We used the Gisette data set for illustration. If we increase \u03bbs , we initially also increase the stability. Yet, for \u03bbs > 1, the feature selection stability suffers. We observed similar effects for all remaining data sets. This suggests that stable feature sets depend not only on the uncertainty, but also on the importance of features. \u03bbs = 0.01 was set as our default value throughout the experiments, because it provided the best balance between predictive power and stability in all data sets."
