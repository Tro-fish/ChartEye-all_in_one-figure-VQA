As Figure 4 shows, in this structure, Agent1, Agent2, and Agent receive the input tokens from the enviroment, process them and send the results to Agent4 and Agent5. Finally Agent5 sends the overall result to the environment. A signal from the environment activates this multi-agent system and when each agent completes the operation on its input tokens it will set its done signal and send the value of that result to the agent in the next level. It will inform that agent by sending its done signal to the strobe signal of its successive agent. In this model, hardware agents use done and strobe signals for handshaking."

This shows that AGN feedback is mainly responsible for the characteristic knee of the GSMF. The location of the knee is determined both by the critical halo mass in the star formation efficiency, and the normalisation N, as this causes a horizontal shift of the whole distribution. For the No SN model, the slope of the faint end of the GSMF is much steeper. If feedback process are inefficient both at the low mass and high mass end (a constant fraction of the baryon budget is turned into stars), the GSMF is identical to the halo mass function (dotted grey line) but shifted in mass by a constant value."

It is evident that the transmission is dependent on the outcome of the DCF; there is no deterministic transmission timeline. For this simplified example of DCF, Wi-Fi Node C has data ready for Node B. Since there is no ongoing traffic in the channel, Node C transmits data immediately after the channel is assessed to be clear for a period of DIFS. Upon a successful reception of the data frame from Node C, Node B acknowledges with an ACK frame after the short inter-frame space (SIFS) time period. Since SIFS is defined to be less than DIFS, it preempts other nodes, allowing an immediate delivery of ACK to the transmitter. During this period, Nodes A and B, as well as Node C have new data ready for transmission. However, they all have to wait until the ongoing traffic finishes. Once the channel has been cleared for the DIFS time period, each node has to start a back off timer, uniformly distributed within a contention window of length 3, 14 for Node A, 10 for Node B, and 16 for Node C for example. The timer for Node B expires first and Node B transmits. Node A receives and acknowledges. The timers for Nodes A and C freeze until ACK finishes, and resume after the channel is cleared for the DIFS period of time."

For increased measurement gain (but constant input squeezing) the relative parametric output should therefore converge to a constant level, directly indicating the absolute quadrature intensity. To observe this, we varied the pump intensity in the 2nd (measurement) pass up to 5.5 times the intensity used for generating the broadband squeezing in the 1st (generation) pass. This convergence of the relative output (dots) (GM GS >3) approached a constant level of \u223c 5% below the vacuum level. When the measurement gain is reduced, the relative output decreases due to a quantum interference effect, reaching maximum visibility when the squeezing generation gain is equal to the measurement gain (GM GS = 1). In this regime, the general measurement becomes indirect (although the squeezing effect is still directly evident), and a pair of measurements (amplifying one quadrature and then the other) is needed for extracting the quadrature information. Below the level of identical gain, the observed output strongly rises over the vacuum level, obscuring the direct evidence of squeezing; however, the quadrature information can still be extracted (though with reduced accuracy) using the same pair of measurements. The solid (blue) curve indicates a numerical simulation of the relative output, assuming the measured pump pulse energy and FWM loss, and an estimated nonlinear coefficient, fiber coupling efficiency and hyperbolic-secant pulse shape. For comparison, we included the simulated result for the relative output at the peak of the pulse (dashed green)."

At convergence, i.e. the element abundance ratios remain unchanged, the routine exit the inner loop and the base parameters are re-derived for the computed set of abundance ratios using all indices. This outer loop is iterated until the \u03c7 at step 7 stops improving by less than 1%. Models with varying abundance ratios of the element considered are produced in step -6, while models perturbed around the previously derived base parameters are produced in step 7.

This is because DR methods typically work well when the unseen target is within the scope of the class of random perturbations that are made on the source which is not the case always. In TIGDA on the other hand, every target image is made to resemble the source image through implicit sampling. Since VAE learns to sample from the entire source domain, the domain shift is implicitly reduced during inference without explicitly assuming any form for the shift.

However, in a quantum optical lattice, the evolution for the same depth, but different photon numbers is strikingly different.

Decreasing the photon number in a cavity (the mean photon numbers are 24.2, 4., 0.97 and 0.19), the role of light fluctuations increases, which drives the atomic fluctuations destroying the MI state.

In fact, the system performance is mainly array mismatches-constrained at high SNR, and undoubtedly \u2018Optimal-COBP\u2019 outperforms \u2018No-COBP\u2019 since the former mitigates the impact of array mismatches with COBP. However, the system performance is noise-constrained at low SNR and thus \u2018No-COBP\u2019 with fewer parameters to be estimated than \u2018Optimal-COBP\u2019 will be superior. 4) The CRB obtained for different numbers of subarrays almost coincide, and the reason could be explained as follows. On the one hand, more estimation parameters would increase CRB. On the other hand, mismatches across more subarrays could enhance antenna diversities and thereby improve CRB. These two factors appear to offset each other approximately. In fact, the numerical MSEs of \u2018Optimal-COBP\u2019 under different number of subarrays also asymptotically converge at high SNR. This also proves the effectiveness of COBP in mitigating the detrimental effects of inter-subarray gain and phase mismatches."

The grey dashed line is the cumulative hazard rate, which is a linear function through the origin with gradient 1 . The four rate functions displayed in fig. 1 are sections through this contour plot along the dotted black lines: The grey squares in fig. 1 are the intersection of the dotted black lines and the dashed grey cumulative hazard rate, the thin dashed lines in fig. 1 represent some of the contour lines from the figure shown here. As t increases and the tail probabilities decrease accordingly, the lines on the upper left half of the picture diverge faster from the cumulative hazard rate than on the lower right half of the picture, showing that the rate of convergence is lower on the upper left side. Note that since the rate functions are only determined by the tail probabilities, and all tail probabilities occur in an exponential distribution, the corresponding contour plot for any random variable can be derived from this plot by a transformation of the t-axis.

(135) and the single-repeater bound [39, 40] of Eq. (136). The key rates are expressed in terms of bits per channel use and plotted versus distance (km) at the standard fiber-loss rate of 0.2 dB per km. In particular, below the PLOB bound we consider: (CV) One-way coherent-state protocol with heterodyne detection [376], which coincides with the most asymmetric protocol for CV-MDI-QKD [182]. For long distances, the rate scales as 1/2 of the PLOB bound. The same asymptotic scaling is found for the coherent-state protocol with homodyne detection [455]; (1ph-BB84) The ideal BB84 protocol, implemented with single-photon sources [77]. This achieves the ideal rate of \u03b7/2; (decoy-BB84) BB84 protocol implemented with weak coherent pulses and decoy states achieving the ideal rate of \u03b7/(2e); (DV-MDI) Ideal implementation of a passive MDI-QKD node [176, 177]. In particular, we plot the ideal performance of decoy state DV-MDI-QKD [177] with a rate of \u03b7/(2e2). Then, we consider relay-assisted protocols able to beat the PLOB bound. In particular: (TF) Twin-field QKD protocol [183]; (PM) phase-matching QKD protocol [185]; (SNS) sending or not sending version of TF-QKD [187]; (AOPP) Active odd-parity pair protocol [190], which is an improved formulation of the SNS protocol; (NPPTF) No-phase-postselected TF-QKD protocol [191], including the variant of Ref.

Next, we consider three datasets for transfer learning: First, we identified 30 T1w MRI of children with manually corrected volumetric labels, and accuracy of automated segmentation was defined relative to the manually provided truth. Second, we used the original 45 manually traced atlas from adult brains used in SLANT to refine the initial pretrained segmentation. Third, we retrieved 36 paired datasets of pre- and postcontrast clinically acquired T1w MRI, and accuracy of the post-contrast segmentations were assessed relative to the pre-contrast automated assessment."
