    Answer: frequency shift due to a neutron edm of dn =  × 0−25 e cm and 75 kv/cm electric field in a critically dressed system of 3he and neutrons. excellent agreement is observed between the shift predicted from the simulation (∆ωsim) and the higher order perturbation theory (∆ωpt). the deviation from the simulation and the shift predicted from the j0 approximation (∆ωj) is apparent at lower frequencies. the deviation from a constant for the j0 approximation is due to deviation of xc from that given by eq. 7. for these calculations b0 = 3 µt giving ω ′ 0 ∼ 380 rad/s.

    Answer: constraints on the nir fluence of x-ray bursts from sgr 1935+215 based on limits from palomar gattini-ir. for comparison, we show the observed x-ray and radio fluence of frb 20028 (in red) detected by chime and stare2 in coincidence with a hard x-ray burst detected by hxmt, integral, agile and konus-wind. optical limit from the bootes telescope for frb 20028 is also shown. limits from the pgir campaign are shown in orange, with transparent circles showing raw limits, while solid squares show extinction corrected limits for aj = 2.0 mag. the four x-ray bursts detected by hxmt and nustar during the pgir observing sessions (labels indicated as per table 2) are shown with yellow dashed lines connecting the corresponding nir limits. for each x-ray burst, we place the fluence at the frequency corresponding to the peak of the fluence spectrum (= νfν) observed in the x-rays (and its uncertainty). the estimated fluence peak for bursts a and b are consistent with the observed spectrum of the bursts from nustar observations (borghese et al. 2020), where the fluence is observed to rise up to at least ∼ 20 kev. in the case of burst c and d, the fluence spectrum was not well constrained and hence are placed nominally at 10 kev with error-bars spanning the full hxmt sensitivity range. the observed fluence index for frb 20028, and constraints derived for the x-ray bursts are shown.

    Answer: the scaled density to velocity fluctuation ratio ( 𝜂2scaled ) as a function of fr⊥ for the high-resolution simulations from this study and from mfs20. the ratio (𝜂2 𝑘 ) is averaged over the inertial range of turbulence (6 ≤ 𝑘 ≤ 15). the fit (solid line) shown is plotted using m = 0.25 and 𝑅𝑃𝑆 = 2.33, corresponding to the parameters used in mfs20. the ratio (𝜂2 𝑘 ) roughly scales as 𝜎2?̄?/m2 and is independent of m in the strongly stratified turbulence limit. we also show the values of 𝜂2scaled and fr clusters from zhuravleva et al.

    Answer: frequency shift due to a neutron edm of dn =  × 0−25 e cm and 75 kv/cm electric field in a critically dressed system of 3he and neutrons. excellent agreement is observed between the shift predicted from the simulation (∆ωsim) and the higher order perturbation theory (∆ωpt). the deviation from the simulation and the shift predicted from the j0 approximation (∆ωj) is apparent at lower frequencies. the deviation from a constant for the j0 approximation is due to deviation of xc from that given by eq. 7. for these calculations b0 = 3 µt giving ω ′ 0 ∼ 380 rad/s.

    Answer: frequency shift due to a neutron edm of dn =  × 0−25 e cm and 75 kv/cm electric field in a critically dressed system of 3he and neutrons. excellent agreement is observed between the shift predicted from the simulation (∆ωsim) and the higher order perturbation theory (∆ωpt). the deviation from the simulation and the shift predicted from the j0 approximation (∆ωj) is apparent at lower frequencies. the deviation from a constant for the j0 approximation is due to deviation of xc from that given by eq. 7. for these calculations b0 = 3 µt giving ω ′ 0 ∼ 380 rad/s.

    Answer: graphical representation of our hierarchical probabilistic model. plates indicate independent, identically distributed variables: the observed galaxies and the model sed templates. squares indicate fixed parameters or model components: the analytic form of the priors and the noise recalibration, as well as the linear sed bases used in the templates, their corrections and variances. circles or round boxes refer to random variables. we optimize for the hyperparameters of the model, α, β, and γ, and marginalize over the intrinsic true properties of the objects (true photometry, redshift, type, luminosity). the shaded rounded box refer to observed random variables, i.e., the measured fluxes and their noise. standard template fitting typically only include the left part of the model, without sed or photometric corrections, or with simple corrections not optimized simultaneously with the priors and other parameters of the model. the novelty of our approach lies in the greater flexibility of the model, its causal structure, and the joint optimization of all the parameters for obtaining photometric redshifts.

    Answer: a multi-agent system to implement the data flow operations of figure 2 by implementing this data flow graph with hardware agents we benefit from the speed of the specialized hardware in processing the input tokens and producing the results. five hardware agents cooperate together to form a multi-agent architecture for this data flow graph. as figure 4 shows, in this structure, agent1, agent2, and agent receive the input tokens from the enviroment, process them and send the results to agent4 and agent5. finally agent5 sends the overall result to the environment. a signal from the environment activates this multi-agent system and when each agent completes the operation on its input tokens it will set its done signal and send the value of that result to the agent in the next level. it will inform that agent by sending its done signal to the strobe signal of its successive agent. in this model, hardware agents use done and strobe signals for handshaking.

    Answer: constraints on the nir fluence of x-ray bursts from sgr 1935+215 based on limits from palomar gattini-ir. for comparison, we show the observed x-ray and radio fluence of frb 20028 (in red) detected by chime and stare2 in coincidence with a hard x-ray burst detected by hxmt, integral, agile and konus-wind. optical limit from the bootes telescope for frb 20028 is also shown. limits from the pgir campaign are shown in orange, with transparent circles showing raw limits, while solid squares show extinction corrected limits for aj = 2.0 mag. the four x-ray bursts detected by hxmt and nustar during the pgir observing sessions (labels indicated as per table 2) are shown with yellow dashed lines connecting the corresponding nir limits. for each x-ray burst, we place the fluence at the frequency corresponding to the peak of the fluence spectrum (= νfν) observed in the x-rays (and its uncertainty). the estimated fluence peak for bursts a and b are consistent with the observed spectrum of the bursts from nustar observations (borghese et al. 2020), where the fluence is observed to rise up to at least ∼ 20 kev. in the case of burst c and d, the fluence spectrum was not well constrained and hence are placed nominally at 10 kev with error-bars spanning the full hxmt sensitivity range. the observed fluence index for frb 20028, and constraints derived for the x-ray bursts are shown.

    Answer: susceptibilities χij in a system of n = 4 cernas, as a function of mirna transcription rate β (all other parameters being fixed). in this example cernas are cast in two groups: group a, formed by cernas m1 and m, and group b, formed by cernas m2 and m4. cernas belonging to the same group share identical kinetic parameters. in particular, µ0,1 = µ0, µ0,2 = µ0,4. while for β smaller than about 500 no cross-talk is observed, as β increases a symmetric interaction between cernas in group a (of magnitude comparable to the self-susceptibilities) appears: χ1 = χ1 ' χ11 = χ. as β increases further, this interaction is switched off, and cernas in group b begin to crosstalk instead: χ42 = χ24 ' χ22 = χ44. in this region, a change of transcription of a cerna in group a can affect the level of cernas in group b, but not viceversa (asymmetric crosstalk): χ21 = χ2 = χ41 = χ4 >> χ12 = χ2 = χ14 = χ4. finally, for sufficiently large β all no cross-talk takes place.

    Answer: the topology of the policy network with instinct module. both networks receive the same input from the environment. the instinctual network outputs an instinctual action ~ai and a suppression signal ~s. the suppression signal is a vector of values between 0 and 1 that determines the magnitude of instinctual action that will be mixed in the policy action. the suppression signal ~s is multiplied with policy action ~ap and the opposite suppression signal ~1−~s is multiplied with the instinctual action ~ai. two action values are finally added resulting in the final action ~af .
