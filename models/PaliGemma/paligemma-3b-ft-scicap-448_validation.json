As Figure 4 shows, in this structure, Agent1, Agent2, and Agent receive the input tokens from the enviroment, process them and send the results to Agent4 and Agent5. Finally Agent5 sends the overall result to the environment. A signal from the environment activates this multi-agent system and when each agent completes the operation on its input tokens it will set its done signal and send the value of that result to the agent in the next level. It will inform that agent by sending its done signal to the strobe signal of its successive agent. In this model, hardware agents use done and strobe signals for handshaking."

The isolated dot on the right hand side with X coordinate 100% and y coordinate 40.7% corresponds to the female percentage for all Australian journal articles, which is 40.7% overall. The gap between this point and the rest of the graph corresponds to the percentage of uncited articles."

The scattered component is derived by subtracting the surface spectrum to the cloud spectrum (see section 2.b). We have also taken into account a typical cloud transmission of 0.99 (Figure 4b). The highest uncertainty is related to the choice of the nearby surface spectrum: the two (red and blue) observed spectra correspond to 2 extreme possible choices in surface spectrum. Then, we have looked for the best fit of the model to these observations by adjusting the optical depth at 0.5 \u00b5m and the mean particle size. The resulting values are reff = 1.0 \u00b5m and \u03c4 = 0.22 for the blue spectrum and reff = 1.4 \u00b5m and \u03c4 = 0.17 for the red spectrum."

We consider the effect of cosmological perturbations on the merger rate of PBH binaries in three different cases, labeled as case A, B and C, consistent with the observational constraints. The vertical shaded band corresponds to the scales k0 characteristic of binaries which would be merging at the present time, in the mass range m \u223c 1\u2212100. The vertical dashed line corresponds to the pivot scale kB \u2248 5\u00b710Mpc\u22121 in Eq. (4.8). For illustration, in dashed red line we plot the power spectrum of an inflationary model, which raises steeply with spectral index p \u2248 4 up to a scale kC \u2248  \u00b7 106Mpc\u22121, leading to a rather broad peak spanning one order of magnitude or so. This corresponds to a model [42] where the inflaton goes from slow roll to fast roll and then back to slow roll, through a discrete sequence of values of the second slow roll parameter \u03b7 (see Fig. 10 of [42])."

It is evident that the transmission is dependent on the outcome of the DCF; there is no deterministic transmission timeline. For this simplified example of DCF, Wi-Fi Node C has data ready for Node B. Since there is no ongoing traffic in the channel, Node C transmits data immediately after the channel is assessed to be clear for a period of DIFS. Upon a successful reception of the data frame from Node C, Node B acknowledges with an ACK frame after the short inter-frame space (SIFS) time period. Since SIFS is defined to be less than DIFS, it preempts other nodes, allowing an immediate delivery of ACK to the transmitter. During this period, Nodes A and B, as well as Node C have new data ready for transmission. However, they all have to wait until the ongoing traffic finishes. Once the channel has been cleared for the DIFS time period, each node has to start a back off timer, uniformly distributed within a contention window of length 3, 14 for Node A, 10 for Node B, and 16 for Node C for example. The timer for Node B expires first and Node B transmits. Node A receives and acknowledges. The timers for Nodes A and C freeze until ACK finishes, and resume after the channel is cleared for the DIFS period of time."

For increased measurement gain (but constant input squeezing) the relative parametric output should therefore converge to a constant level, directly indicating the absolute quadrature intensity. To observe this, we varied the pump intensity in the 2nd (measurement) pass up to 5.5 times the intensity used for generating the broadband squeezing in the 1st (generation) pass. This convergence of the relative output (dots) (GM GS >3) approached a constant level of \u223c 5% below the vacuum level. When the measurement gain is reduced, the relative output decreases due to a quantum interference effect, reaching maximum visibility when the squeezing generation gain is equal to the measurement gain (GM GS = 1). In this regime, the general measurement becomes indirect (although the squeezing effect is still directly evident), and a pair of measurements (amplifying one quadrature and then the other) is needed for extracting the quadrature information. Below the level of identical gain, the observed output strongly rises over the vacuum level, obscuring the direct evidence of squeezing; however, the quadrature information can still be extracted (though with reduced accuracy) using the same pair of measurements. The solid (blue) curve indicates a numerical simulation of the relative output, assuming the measured pump pulse energy and FWM loss, and an estimated nonlinear coefficient, fiber coupling efficiency and hyperbolic-secant pulse shape. For comparison, we included the simulated result for the relative output at the peak of the pulse (dashed green)."

The probabilities correspond to the final element of the eigenvector of K with eigenvalue 1. For c = 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5, the overflow probability falls off exponentially with the cutoff volume V/\u2206 until the overflow probability becomes small enough to be sensitive to numerical errors. The policy with c = 2.2 operates in an unstable regime (see Fig. 6) and the overflow probability falls off extremely slowly with the cutoff, reflecting the non-normalizability of the unstable distribution.

While DR provides performance boost, they have poorer performance as compared to TIGDA. This is because DR methods typically work well when the unseen target is within the scope of the class of random perturbations that are made on the source which is not the case always. In TIGDA on the other hand, every target image is made to resemble the source image through implicit sampling. Since VAE learns to sample from the entire source domain, the domain shift is implicitly reduced during inference without explicitly assuming any form for the shift. It is also observed that the performance of the classifier when trained and tested on single source domain (around 92- 9% for all the datasets) do not degrade with TIGDA."

In fact, the system performance is mainly array mismatches-constrained at high SNR, and undoubtedly \u2018Optimal-COBP\u2019 outperforms \u2018No-COBP\u2019 since the former mitigates the impact of array mismatches with COBP. However, the system performance is noise-constrained at low SNR and thus \u2018No-COBP\u2019 with fewer parameters to be estimated than \u2018Optimal-COBP\u2019 will be superior. 4) The CRB obtained for different numbers of subarrays almost coincide, and the reason could be explained as follows. On the one hand, more estimation parameters would increase CRB. On the other hand, mismatches across more subarrays could enhance antenna diversities and thereby improve CRB. These two factors appear to offset each other approximately. In fact, the numerical MSEs of \u2018Optimal-COBP\u2019 under different number of subarrays also asymptotically converge at high SNR.

The correlation metric C (Eq. 2) measures quality of estimation, where we used different priors in the MAP estimate: L1 (Eq. 20); L0 (Eq. 22); D - Dale\u2019s Law [, section 2.5.2]; sbm - type dependent connection strength (stochastic block model, section 4.3.2) in which we only in advance know the number of types (two, which is also the rank of V); dd - distance dependent connection probability in which we f (d) has the general form 1/ (1 + exp (ad+ b)), but we do not know a and b (section 4.3.3); Ksbm - stochastic block model with a known mean block matrix V ;and Kdd - distance dependent connection probability with a known function f (d).

In summary, 90 independent APSIM-Wheat parameters considered as \u201ccomponent traits\u201d were selected to reflect a potential genetic variability. Each of the 90 component traits was assumed to vary in a \u00b1 20% range around the value for the reference cultivar \u201cHartog\u201d\" and the Morris method [37,38] was used to sample the total parameter space (90 traits, 6 levels, 00 reps; i.e. 900 \u201cgenotypes\u201d). Simulations for those genotypes were performed with APSIM-Wheat (Version 7.5). The impact of the 90 component traits were considered for 8 output variables (\u201cintegrated traits\u201d, Table 2). The impact on crop yield allowed to screen component traits for influential traits (n=42) in the target population of environments while a study on trait x environment interactions was used to explore their variability across environments."

Second, we used the original 45 manually traced atlas from adult brains used in SLANT to refine the initial pretrained segmentation.

While an inflammatory infiltrate, bone erosion, and cartilage serration were visible on day 5, no signs of joint pathology was detectable on day 5 or in saline controls. Scale bar represents 00 \u00b5m. *, \u25bc, and V point to signs of synovitis, bone erosion, and cartilage destruction, respectively. (E\u2013G) Scores for inflammatory hallmarks as synovitis (E), bone erosion (F), and loss of cartilage (G) revealed mild ankle joint pathology in two of eight mice day 5 and prominent signs in all mice day 5 (n = 5). Control mice represent pooled time-matched saline-injected mice (n = 4+4). (H and I) Quantitative PCR analysis of joint extracts showed a significant increase in mRNA levels of most of the inflammatory factors investigated at day 5 (n = 7), while none of them were elevated at day 5 of CAIA (n = 6), compared with saline controls (n = 5; H and I). (J and K) Activation of MMPswas significantly increased only after 5 d of CAIA, while no changes were detected at day 5 (n = 3/group, B0.RIII mice).

Each entry is a sequence letter (one of the four nucleotides A, G, C and T). In the data analyzed in Section VI one of the sequence letters can also be N (anything). The covariance matrix Cij between any two loci i and j is then computed by reading the i-th and the j-th column of matrix A, and the column pair (i, j) is given a score. In Section VI the score used is Mutual Information (MI). The m column pairs of largest scores are selected. After considering the ` \u2264 2m loci involved in these M pairs, the original MSA matrix A is reduced to the new N \u00d7 ` MSA matrix B for further analysis by some version of DCA."

An increase in consumption propensity to c = 0.7 (0.2 above pre-crisis levels) and a helicopter money drop at the end of the shock leads to a faster recovery (U-shaped recovery).

Prices for coal and nuclear power are costs in the US in dollars per kilowatt hour (scale on the left) whereas solar modules are in dollars per watt-peak, i.e. the cost for the capacity to generate a watt of electricity in full sunlight (scale on the right). For coal we use units of the cost of the coal that would need to be burned in a modern US plant if it were necessary to buy the coal at its inflation-adjusted price at different points in the past. Nuclear prices are Busbar costs for US nuclear plants in the year in which they became operational (from Cooper (2009)). The alignment of the left and right vertical axes is purely suggestive; based on recent estimates of levelized costs, we took $0.77/kWh = $0.82/Wp in 203 (203$). The number $0.77/kWh is a global value produced as a projection for 203 by the International Energy Agency (Table 4 in International Energy Agency (204)). We note that it is compatible with estimated values (Table  in Baker et al. (203), Fig. 4 in International Energy Agency (204)). The red cross is the agreed price for the planned UK Nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point which is scheduled to come online in 2023 (\u00a30.0925 \u2248 $0.4).

Interbank exposures are assigned with the RAS algorithm so that, for each bank, the total interbank assets and the total interbank liabilities match the value in the balance sheets. We then progressively create new interbank exposures (i.e. we randomly add new edges to the interbank network), until all possible exposures have been created (i.e. until the interbank network is a complete graph). Every time a new edge is added, we re-balance the interbank exposures so that, for each bank, the total interbank assets and the total interbank liabilities do not change. As a consequence, the degree of diversification in the banking system gradually increases and all interbank leverages do not change. The stability of the network is constantly monitored by re-computing the largest eigenvalue of the interbank leverage matrix every time a new edge is added. We repeat the whole procedure 100 times. We show the contour of all trajectories and highlight a few of them. The first crossing region (in semi-transparent blue), spans the interval of densities of edges across which the networks become unstable for the first time, meaning that combined unstable cycles appear. We can see that densities as low as 3% are sufficient to reach instability. We also plot the average interbank leverage (dashed blue line) for reference.
